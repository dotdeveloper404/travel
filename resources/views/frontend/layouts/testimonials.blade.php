                                for my first-ever trip to Istanbul. And booking with iLinkTurkey, I was not
                                disappointed.
                                They offered airport transfers, accommodations, and breakfasts to go along with the
                                city's tour, which the entire 3 days there worth it. The booking process was extremely
                                easy, and we had a tour guide that spoke English, so we got to learn the rich history
                                along sightseeing.
                                My family and I definitely recommend iLinkTurkey, especially their Istanbul Tours.

                                when we booked our Ephesus Package from iLinkTurkey. The guide knew the place locally

                                the ancient site with local expertise. We also had flexibility in the program and

                                Second time booking iLinkTurkey's tours and this experience was amazing as the first.
                                Visited ancient and cultural spots, and ate Turkish kebabs for breakfast, but the
                                Bosphorus cruise was the highlight. The ocean was beautiful. The hotel was comfortable
                                and accommodating. Had a blast, would definitely recommend.

                                The tour was really great. The program was planned very nicely, with breaks so we could
                                relax and stroll a little on our own. The sights in Konya, Cappadocia, and Bursa were
                                never ending and the guide did their very best in explaining all the history. Was sad to
                                leave on the last day but the experience was worth every cent. I would suggest
                                ilinkturkey to anyone who wants to have a nice time in Turkey. </p>
